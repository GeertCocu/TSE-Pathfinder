## About the Engine

The **Top Shot Engine** is a completely custom-built C++ engine specifically designed for creating shooter games on Windows and PSVita.

### The Engine Features

- Grid-based navigation generation
- Dijkstra-based AI movement
- Entity Component System
- DX12 Rendering
- Custom Editor

## About the Project

Together with 3 other programmers, we were tasked to create an engine for designers and artists to use to create [FPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_person_shooter) games. We aimed to develop this engine within 8 weeks.

## My Contribution

My main contribution to this project was to create a tool that would generate a navigation "mesh" for AI, along with pathfinding logic that could be applied to this navigation "mesh."
